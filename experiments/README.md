- Create a folder with your name to run your experiments
- Create your notebooks in your folder
- Follow the practice of naming your notebooks and follow a number scheme. Ex.
    - 00_data_exploration.ipynb
    - 01_feature_engineering.ipynb
    - 02_baseline_model.ipynb
- Keep restructuring your code and keep your folders organized
- A sample folder structure to keep your experimentation space clean
